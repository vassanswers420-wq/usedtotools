    <h2 class="section-title">What is EMI?</h2>
    <p class="section-desc">
      EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) is the fixed payment you make every month towards repaying a loan. It includes both principal and interest, making it easier to plan monthly finances.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">How EMI is Calculated</h2>
    <p class="section-desc">
      EMI is calculated based on the loan amount, interest rate, and tenure. A higher tenure reduces the EMI but increases total interest, while a shorter tenure increases EMI but reduces interest paid.
    </p>
